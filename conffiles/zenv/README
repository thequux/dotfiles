The first line of each script in this directory should be a comment containing
a description of the environment that it sets up. The rest is a bog-standard
shell script, which is sourced with $1 being either "enable" or "disable" as
appropriate.

You are guaranteed that each environment will be enabled once and only once,
unless it is disabled. I.e., the following sequence of env+- calls will have
the following results:

env+ foo | foo enable
env+ foo | -
env+ bar | bar enable
env- foo | -
env- foo | foo disable
env- bar | bar disable
env- qux | error

Only executable scripts will be listed by env?
